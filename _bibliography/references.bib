  abstract = {Network virtualization is an important concept to overcome
    the ossification of today's Internet as if facilitates innovation
    also in the network core and as it promises a more efficient
    use of the given resources and infrastructure. Virtual networks
    (VNets) provide an abstraction of the physical network: multiple
    VNets may cohabit the same physical network, but can be based on
    completely different protocol stacks (also beyond IP). One of the
    main challenges in network virtualization is the efficient admission
    control and embedding of VNets. The demand for virtual networks
    (e.g., for a video conference) can be hard to predict, and once the
    request is accepted, the specification / QoS guarantees must be
    ensured throughout the VNetï¿½s lifetime. This requires an admission
    control algorithm which only selects high-benefit VNets in times
    of scarce resources, and an embedding algorithm which realizes the
    VNet in such a way that the likelihood that future requests can be
    embedded as well is maximized.
    This paper describes a generic algorithm for the online VNet
    embedding problem which does not rely on any knowledge of the
    future VNet requests but whose performance is competitive to an
    optimal offline algorithm that has complete knowledge of the request
    sequence in advance: the so-called competitive ratio is, loosely
    speaking, logarithmic in the sum of the resources. Our algorithm
    is generic in the sense that it supports multiple traffic models,
    multiple routing models, and even allows for nonuniform benefits
    and durations of VNet requests. Concretely, the routing models
    considered in this paper include: multipaths, single paths, and tree
    routing. For modeling traffic, we study the customer-pipe model, the
    hose model, and a new traffic model, called {\it aggregate ingress
    model}, that is well suited for modeling multicasts and multi-party
    video conferences.},

    data from a worst-case perspective, i.e., without any probabilistic
    assumptions on, e.g., the nodes' degree distribution. We attend to
    a scenario where some of the routers are anonymous, and propose
    two fundamental axioms that model two basic assumptions on the
    traceroute data: (1) each trace corresponds to a real path in the
    network, and (2) the routing paths are at most a factor 1/$\alpha$
    off the shortest paths, for some parameter $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1]. In
    contrast to existing literature that focuses on the cardinality of
    the set of (often only minimal) inferrable topologies, we argue that
    a large number of possible topologies alone is often unproblematic,
    as long as the networks have a similar structure. We hence seek
    to characterize the set of topologies inferred with our axioms.
    We introduce the notion of star graphs whose colorings capture
    the differences among inferred topologies; it also allows us to
    construct inferred topologies explicitly. We find that in general,
    inferrable topologies can differ significantly in many important
    aspects, such as the nodes' distances or the number of triangles.
    These negative results are complemented by a discussion of a
    scenario where the trace set is best possible, i.e., ''complete''. It
    turns out that while some properties such as the node degrees are
    still hard to measure, a complete trace set can help to determine
    global properties such as the connectivity.")"},

    distributed systems in which resources can be dynamically allocated
    at locations where they are most useful. In order to fully exploit
    the benefits of this new technology, protocols need to be devised
    which react efficiently to changes in the demand. This paper argues
    that the field of online algorithms and competitive analysis
    provides useful tools to deal with and reason about the uncertainty
    in the request dynamics, and to design algorithms with provable
    performance guarantees.
    As a case study, we describe a system (e.g., a gaming application)
    where network virtualization is used to support thin client
    applications for mobile devices to improve their QoS. By decoupling
    the service from the underlying resource infrastructure, it can be
    migrated closer to the current client locations while taking into
    account migration cost. This paper identifies the major cost factors
    in such a system, and formalizes the corresponding optimization
    problem. Both randomized and deterministic, gravity center based
    online algorithms are presented which achieve a good tradeoff
    between improved QoS and migration cost in the worst-case, both for
    service migration within an infrastructure provider as well as for
    networks supporting cross-provider migration. The paper reports on

    e.g., by migrating servers or/and parts of the network. We study a
    system (e.g., a gaming application) where network virtualization
    is used to support thin client applications for mobile devices to
    improve their QoS. To deal with the dynamics of both the mobile
    clients as well as the ability to migrate services closer to the
    client location we advocate, in this paper, the use of competitive
    analysis. After identifying the parameters that characterize the
    cost-benefit tradeoff for this kind of application we propose an
    online migration strategy. The strength of the strategy is that it
    is robust with regards to any arbitrary request access pattern. In
    particular, it is close to the optimal offline algorithm that knows
    the access pattern in advance.
    In this paper we present both an optimal offline algorithm based on
    dynamic programming techniques to find the best migration paths for
    a given request sequence, and a {\it O($\mu;$log n)}-competitive
    migration strategy Mig where $\mu$ is the ratio between maximal and
    minimal link capacity in the substrate network for a simplified
    model. This is almost optimal for small $\mu;$, as we also show that
    there are networks where no online algorithm can achieve a ratio
    below {\it $\Omega$(log n/log log n)}. In contrast, the optimal
    solution without migration can only achieve a competitive ratio that
    is linear in the network diameter. Our simulations indicate that the
    competitive ratio of Mig is robust to the network size, and that the
    ratio is small if the request},

  abstract = {The efficient coordination of medium access is arguably
    one of the most relevant applications of distributed computing.
    Recently, progress has been made in the design of robust medium
    access (MAC) protocols that guarantee a competitive throughput
    against a powerful jammer which can block the medium an arbitrary
    constant fraction (1-$\epsilon$) of the time. These MAC protocols
    exploit the remaining $\epsilon$-fraction optimally in the sense
    that a significant part is used for successful transmissions.
    However, so far these throughput guarantees only hold for rather
    simplistic interference models such as Unit Disk Graphs. This paper
    reports on our first insights on the design of a robust medium
    access protocol SinrMac for the more realistic physical interference
    model which takes into account the signal to interference plus noise
    ratio (SINR) at the receiver. This model is more difficult, as
    there is no longer an objective distinction of idling and busy time
    periods which can be used to dynamically adjust the wireless nodes'
    backoff periods. We discuss an approach that introduces individual
    ``idle/busy thresholds'' which are adapted dynamically and, unlike
    the multiplicative backoff periods, in an {\it additive} manner. We
    find that a reasonable convergence speed (and throughput) can be
    achieved if there exists some meaningful upper bound $\tau$
    on the noise level in the network; surprisingly, however, our first
    simulation results indicate that adaptive changes of the idly/busy
    thresholds do not yield a better throughput than static thresholds
    set to $\tau$.},

  abstract = {This article reports on the results of our measurement
    study of the Kad network. Although several fully decentralized
    peer-to-peer systems have been proposed in the literature, most
    existing systems still employ a centralized architecture. The Kad
    network is a notable exception. Since the demise of the Overnet
    network, the Kad network has become the most popular peer-to-peer
    system based on a distributed hash table. It is likely that its user
    base will continue to grow in numbers over the next few years due to
    the system's scalability and reliability.
    The contribution of the article is twofold. First, we compare the
    two networks accessed by eMule: the centralized paradigm of the
    eDonkey network and the structured, distributed approach pursued
    by the Kad network. We re-engineer the eDonkey server software
    and integrate two modified servers into the eDonkey network in
    order to monitor traffic. Additionally, we implement a Kad client
    exploiting a design weakness to spy on the traffic at arbitrary
    locations in the ID space. The collected data provides insights
    into the spacial and temporal distributions of the peers' activity.
    Moreover, it allows us to study the searched content. The article
    also discusses problems related to the collection of such data sets
    and investigates techniques to verify the representativeness of the
    measured data.
    Second, this article shows that today's Kad network can be attacked
    in several ways. Our simple attacks could be used either to hamper
    the correct functioning of the network itself, to censor content, or
    to harm other entities in the Internet not participating in the Kad
    network, such as ordinary web servers. While there are heuristics to
    improve the robustness of Kad, we believe that the attacks cannot be
    thwarted easily in a fully decentralized peer-to-peer system, i.e.,
    without some kind of a centralized certification and verification
    authority. This result may be relevant in the context of the current
    debate on the design of a clean-slate network architecture for the
    Internet which is based on concepts known from the peer-to-peer
    paradigm.},

    protocol for wireless networks where nodes communicate over a
    shared medium. SELECT is very robust in two respects. First, the
    protocol is self-stabilizing in the sense that it converges to a
    correct solution from any possible initial network state (e.g.,
    where no or multiple nodes consider themselves a leader). This is
    an appealing property, especially for dynamic networks. Second, the
    described protocol is resilient against a powerful reactive jammer
    that blocks a significant fraction of all communication rounds. The
    reactive model is general and of interest beyond jamming (e.g., in
    the context of co-existing networks). The paper also reports on

    especially in a network of simple wireless devices such as
    sensor nodes, which usually operate over a single frequency (or
    a limited frequency band) and which cannot benefit from the use
    of spread spectrum or other more advanced technologies. This
    paper proposes the medium access (MAC) protocol ANTIJAM which is
    provably robust against a powerful reactive adversary who can jam
    a (1-$\varepsilon$)-portion of the time steps, where $\varepsilon$
    is an arbitrary constant. The adversary uses carrier sensing to
    make informed decisions on when it is most harmful to disrupt
    communications. Moreover, we allow the adversary to be adaptive
    and to have complete knowledge of the entire protocol history.
    Our MAC protocol is able to make efficient use of the nonjammed
    time periods and achieves a $\Theta$(1)-competitive throughput in
    this harsh scenario, if $\varepsilon$ is constant. In addition,
    ANTIJAM features a low convergence time and has excellent fairness
    properties in the sense that channel access probabilities among
    nodes do not differ by more than a small constant factor.},

    influence games by promising payments to the players depending
    on their mutual choice of strategies. First, we investigate the
    cost of implementing a desirable behavior and present algorithms
    to compute this cost. Whereas a mechanism designer can decide
    efficiently whether strategy profiles can be implemented at no cost
    at all our complexity analysis indicates that computing an optimal
    implementation is generally {\bf NP}-hard.
    Second, we introduce and analyze the concept of {\it leverage} in
    a game. The leverage captures the benefits that a benevolent or a
    malicious mechanism designer can achieve by implementing a certain
    strategy profile region within economic reason, i.e., by taking the
    implementation cost into account. Mechanism designers can often
    manipulate games and change the social welfare by a larger extent
    than the amount of money invested. Unfortunately, computing the
    leverage turns out to be intractable as well in the general case.},

  abstract = {Distributed systems are often dynamic in the sense
    that there are frequent membership changes (nodes joining and
    leaving the network), either due to regular churn or due to an
    attack. Maintaining availability and full functionality of such
    a system under continuous topological changes hence constitutes
    an important algorithmic challenge. This paper reports on some of
    our recent results on robust distributed systems. We review two
    randomized architectures that build upon the continuous-discrete
    approach by Naor and Wieder, namely the {\it SHELL network} which
    allows for fast joins and leaves and organizes more reliable (or
    stronger) nodes in a core network where their communication is
    not affected by malicious (or weak) nodes, and the {\it Chameleon
    network} whose replica placement strategy and whose intentional
    topological updates ensure resiliency against denial-of-service
    attacks, even from past insiders. To complement our investigations
    on randomized architectures, we discuss algorithms to maintain
    hypercubic networks under worstcase churn. Finally, we advocate the
    design of self-stabilizing topologies---a very appealing and still
    not well-understood notion of robustness---that converge quickly
    to a desirable structure from arbitrarily degenerated states. As
    a use case, graph linearization is examined in more detail. This

    What is the impact of malicious players on the system consisting

    spread of viruses. In this game, each player or node can choose
    whether or not to install anti-virus software. Then, a virus starts
    from a random node and recursively infects all neighboring nodes
    which are not inoculated. We establish various results about this

  abstract = {Peer-to-peer (p2p) computing is one of the most
    intriguing new networking paradigms of the last ten years, and many
    applications today use peer-to-peer technology, e.g. for large
    distributed computations, for file sharing, or for live media
    streaming. At the heart of the paradigm lies the idea of leveraging
    the resources of the system's participants. Thus, potentially
    scalable and robust architectures can be built.
    However, making use of the decentralized resources is challenging.
    The peers are under the control of the individual users who may only
    connect to the network for a short period of time. Consequently,
    there are frequent membership changes and p2p systems are highly
    dynamic. In addition to regular joins and leaves, the participating
    machines (often unreliable desktops) may crash. Peer-to-peer
    solutions are also faced with the fact that it is not always in
    the (anonymous) users' interest to contribute their resources.
    Rather, a user may be selfish and seek to exploit the system without
    reciprocating.
    This dissertation studies the challenges of the dynamics in p2p
    computing and of cooperation. We describe a system which is
    based on a hypercubic topology and which applies algorithms that
    maintain desirable network properties despite worst-case joins
    and leaves; these algorithms can also be used for pancake graphs.
    Besides membership dynamics, we investigate dynamic changes of
    the available bandwidth between two peers, and we analyze the
    throughput of different transfer protocols. In order to emphasize
    the importance of the cooperation challenge, we conduct a case study
    of BitTorrent--one of the most traffic intensive applications on
    the Internet--, and show that today's peer-to-peer networks still
    fail to fend off uncooperative peers. A game-theoretic analysis
    of a p2p network creation game is presented which estimates the
    impact of selfish behavior. We find that both the performance and
    the stability of a system can suffer severely. In addition, this
    dissertation introduces a mathematical framework which allows
    us to evaluate a system's robustness to malicious attacks; the
    framework is also useful for the analysis of social networks. The
    theoretic findings are complemented by a case study which identifies
    vulnerabilities in the popular Kad network.},

    huge amounts of resources. Unfortunately, however, it has been shown
    that most of today's p2p networks suffer from a large fraction
    of free-riders, who consume resources without contributing much
    to the system themselves. This results in an overall performance
    degradation, and hence proper incentives are needed to encourage
    contributions. One interesting resource is bandwidth. Thereby, a
    service differentiation approach seems appropriate, where peers
    contributing higher upload bandwidths are rewarded with higher
    download bandwidths in return. Keeping track of the contribution
    of each peer in an open, decentralized environment, however, is
    a difficult task; many proposed systems are susceptible to false
    reports. Besides being prone to attacks, some solutions have a
    large communication and computation overhead, which can even be
    linear in the number of transactions---an unacceptable burden in
    practical and active systems. In this paper, we propose a reputation
    system which is robust to false reports and overcomes this scaling
    problem. Our results are promising, indicating that the mechanism
    is accurate and efficient especially when applied in systems where

    by allowing some players to be malicious or Byzantine rather than
    selfish. We ask: What is the impact of Byzantine players on the
    system's efficiency compared to purely selfish environments or
    compared to the social optimum? In particular, we introduce the
    Price of Malice which captures this efficiency degradation. As an
    example, we analyze the Price of Malice of a game which models the
    containment of the spread of viruses. In this game, each node can
    choose whether or not to install anti-virus software. Then, a virus
    starts from a random node and iteratively infects all neighboring
    nodes which are not inoculated. We establish various results about
    this game. For instance, we quantify how much the presence of

    mechanisms that incentivize participants to contribute more to a
    common project. As conducting audits might be costly, the principal
    must balance the tradeoff between low auditing costs and the level
    of incentives offered to the participants to exert high effort.
    We present optimal solutions for this optimization problem in
    scenarios, where the project success either depends on all, on any
    or on the majority of the participants succeeding in their subtask.
    In the first case, we additionally find that with an increasing
    principal valuation, there is exactly one transition point where the
    optimal choices for achieving the maximal principal utility switch.
    Compared to a combinatorial agency without the leverage of audits,
    this transition occurs earlier.},

  abstract = {Data dissemination in decentralized networks is often
    realized by using some form of swarming technique. Swarming enables
    nodes to gather dynamically in order to fulfill a certain task
    collaboratively and to exchange resources (typically pieces of files
    or packets of a multimedia data stream). As in most distributed
    systems, swarming applications face the problem that the nodes in
    a network have heterogeneous capabilities or act selfishly. We
    investigate the problem of efficient live data dissemination (e.g.,
    TV streams) in swarms. The live streams should be distributed in
    such a way that only nodes with sufficiently large contributions
    to the system are able to fully receive it---even in the presence
    of freeloading nodes or nodes that upload substantially less
    than required to sustain the multimedia stream. In contrast,
    uncooperative nodes cannot properly receive the data stream as they
    are unable to fill their data buffers in time, incentivizing a fair
    sharing of resources. If the number of selfish nodes increases, our
    emulation results reveal that the situation steadily deteriorates
    for them, while obedient nodes continue to receive virtually all
    packets in time.},

    oblivious in the sense that its structure only depends on the nodes
    currently in the network but not on the past. This allows for fast
    join and leave operations which is desirable in open distributed
    systems with high levels of churn and frequent faults. In fact,
    a node fault or departure can be fixed in SHELL in a constant
    number of communication rounds, which significantly improves the
    best previous bound for distributed heaps. SHELL has interesting
    applications. First, we describe a robust distributed information
    system which is resilient to Sybil attacks of arbitrary scale.
    Second, we show how to organize heterogeneous nodes of arbitrary
    non-uniform capabilities in an overlay network such that the paths
    between any two nodes do not include nodes of lower capacities. This
    property is useful, e.g., for streaming. All these features can be
    achieved without sacrificing scalability: our heap has a de Bruijn
    like topology with node degree {\it O(log^2 n)} and network diameter
    {\it O(log n)}, {\it n} being the total number of nodes in the

    In the field of topological self-stabilization, nodes---e.g.,
    machines in a p2p network---seek to establish a certain network
    structure in a robust manner (see, e.g., [2] for a distributed
    algorithm for skip graphs). While several complexity models have
    been proposed and analyzed over the last years, these models are
    often inappropriate to adequately model parallel efficiency: either
    they are overly pessimistic in the sense that they can force the
    algorithm to work serially, or they are too optimistic in the sense
    that contention issues are neglected. We hope that our approach will
    inspire researchers in the community to analyze other problems from
    this perspective. For a complete technical report about our model,

    likely that its user base will continue to grow in numbers over the
    next few years as, unlike the eDonkey network, it does not depend
    on central servers, which increases scalability and reliability.
    Moreover, the Kad network is more efficient than unstructured
    systems such as Gnutella. However, we show that today's Kad network
    can be attacked in several ways by carrying out several (well-known)
    attacks on the Kad network. The presented attacks could be used
    either to hamper the correct functioning of the network itself,
    to censor contents, or to harm other entities in the Internet not
    participating in the Kad network such as ordinary web servers. While
    there are simple heuristics to reduce the impact of some of the
    attacks, we believe that the presented attacks cannot be thwarted

    a collection of {\it selfish} players that communicate in order to
    maximize their individual utilities. The performance of such games
    can be evaluated through the costs of the system {\it equilibria}:
    the system states in which no player can increase her utility by
    unilaterally changing her behavior. However, assuming that all
    players are selfish and in particular that all players have the
    same utility function may not always be appropriate. Hence, several
    extensions to incorporate also altruistic and malicious behavior
    in addition to selfishness have been proposed over the last years.
    In this paper, we seek to go one step further and study arbitrary
    relationships between participants. In particular, we introduce the
    notion of the {\it social range matrix} and explore the effects of
    the social range matrix on the equilibria in a network game. In
    order to derive concrete results, we propose a simplistic network
    creation game that captures the effect of social relationships among
